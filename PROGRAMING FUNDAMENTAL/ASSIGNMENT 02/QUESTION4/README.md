I ask the user for the number of words and store them in an array. I then use the hasCommonChars() function to check if two words share any common characters. If they do, I group them together. I keep track of which words are already grouped using the grouped[] array to avoid repeating them. Finally, I print the groups, ensuring the output is properly formatted without extra commas.
