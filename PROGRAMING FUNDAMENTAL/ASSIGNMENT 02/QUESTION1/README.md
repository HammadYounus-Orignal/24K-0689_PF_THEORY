 I use an array arr[5] to store five integers that I input using scanf. I initialize two variables, smallest and secsmallest, with a large value (9999) to keep track of the smallest and second smallest numbers in the array. I then use a for loop to take the user input, ensuring that no number entered is greater than 9999; if it is, I print an error message and exit the program. After collecting the values, I use another for loop to iterate through the array, comparing each element with the current smallest and secsmallest values, updating them accordingly. Finally, I display the second smallest number using printf.
