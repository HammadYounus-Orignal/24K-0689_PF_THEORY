In this program, I ask the user for the number of words and then take each word as input using fgets(). I remove consecutive duplicate characters from each word in the wordCompress() function, where I also count how many characters were removed. After processing all words, I print each compressed word along with the number of removed characters. I ensure the output is neatly formatted without extra commas at the end.
