Input:

- NUM is input by the user

Processing 

- The loop continues until NUM becomes 0
- In each iteration:
    - DIGIT is set to the remainder of NUM divided by 10 (NUM % 10), which gives the last digit of NUM
    - SUM is incremented by DIGIT (SUM = SUM + DIGIT)
    - NUM is updated by performing integer division by 10 (NUM = NUM / 10), effectively removing the last digit

Output:

- Once the loop ends (NUM becomes 0),
 the program prints "THE SUM IS: " followed by the calculated SUM
